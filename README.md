# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis project using Python to analyze global COVID-19 trends, implement risk assessment systems, and generate actionable insights from Johns Hopkins University data.

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to:
- Track pandemic progression from 2020-2023
- Implement rule-based risk assessment for countries
- Generate data visualizations and statistical insights
- Provide actionable recommendations for pandemic response
